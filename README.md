# Image-Classification
Image classification to differentiate Scissors, Rock and Paper hand patterns with **Machine Learning**.

This is a class assignment project "Learning Machine Learning for Beginners/ Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula" from **Dicoding**.

To run this code, please open this file with Google Colab (https://colab.google/)

At the end of the code, there is a place where you can upload your own image to determine whether the image you upload is "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors".

This is only a simple implementation of **Machine Learning**. You can use this code for your own referance or project.
